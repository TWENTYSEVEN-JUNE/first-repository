This repository contains an implementation of the classic **FizzBuzz** algorithm.  
FizzBuzz is a common coding exercise to practice conditional logic and control flow.

## ðŸš€ Our Goal

Print numbers from 1 to 100, but replace certain numbers with specific words:

- If the number is divisible by **3**, print `fizz`
- If the number is divisible by **5**, print `buzz`
- If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 5**, print `fizzbuzz`
- Otherwise, print the number itself
